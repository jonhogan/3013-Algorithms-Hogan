## Program 4 - Processing in Trie Tree Time
#### Due: 03-23-2021 (Tuesday @ 12:30 p.m.)

### Trie Time Lookup

- https://www.techiedelight.com/cpp-implementation-trie-data-structure/
- 

### Necessary Files

- Same as [P02](../06-P02/README.md).

## Background

- Same as [P02](../06-P02/README.md).

## Assignment

### Requirements
- Write a program that will read in a dictionary file from [dict_w_defs.json](../../Resources/04-Data/dictionary_files/dict_w_defs.json) and store it in a **Trie Tree**.
- Define a `wordNode` to be a struct or a class to hold a `word` and `definition`.
- The binary tree should hold `wordNodes`.
- Time how long it takes to load the data into your binary search tree (we will use that later as well).
- After your dictionary (tree) is loaded, we are going to perform "autosuggestions" when a user types characters at the console.
- Suggestions will start after 1 character is typed, however only the top 10 suggestions will be printed along with the total number of matching words (example output below).
- The time it takes to find each suggestion will be displayed in seconds.


#### Output Example

- User types the word `ste` 
- Below the word the number of words found and the amount of time in seconds will be printed
- Only print out the first 10 words of the matching words


```
ste

62 words found in 0.013 seconds

stead steadfast steadfastly steadfastness steadied steadier steadies steadiest steadily steadiness

```


- User types the word `steel` 

```
steel

18 words found in 0.003 seconds

steel steele steeled steelers steeles steelhead steelie steelier steelies steeliness 

```

### Deliverables

- Create a folder called **P04** in your assignments folder. 
- **ALL** files used in this project should be in that folder.
- The only documents you need to print and turn in are:
  - Banner
  - Any source code YOU wrote (commented as directed [here](../../Resources/01-Comments/README.md))
  - 4 screen shots (fitted to one page)
  - If your banner is wrong: -1 letter grade. The banner is to keep your programs organized. Or I can stop taking late work ... 



#### Banner

```
P04
3013
LASTNAME
```

#### Example Screen Shot

- Of course your screens will differ slightly, however they should fit on one page
- Be readable and have four examples
- Also the text in my screenshots is small, try and make yours larger even if the words wrap
